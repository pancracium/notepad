# **KNOWN ISSUES**

- ### The undo and redo methods sometimes don't work (neither from the Edit menu nor with CTRL + Z and CTRL + Y).

- ### When you write something and the word counter updates, and then you delete all the text, the word counter still says "1", when there's no text.

- ### When dark mode is on, the borders of the menus' windows don't change to a dark colour.

- ### A lot of bugs with dark mode.

- ### The font menu doesn't work.
