# **KNOWN ISSUES**

- ### The "Toggle counter bar" command on the "View" menu always shows False, even if the counter bar is on.

- ### The word counter updates when the user types a space, but it shouldn't do when there are multiple spaces at once.

- ### The character counter updates when a user inserts a new line, and it shouldn't.

- ### The undo and redo methods sometimes don't work (neither from the Edit menu nor with CTRL + Z and CTRL + Y).

- ### When you write something and the word counter updates, and then you delete all the text, the word counter still says "1", when there's no text.
